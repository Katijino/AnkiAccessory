+ power management modules.

uses SPI/SDIO or I2C/UART interfaces



Integrated Circuit:

Also known as a microchip, chip or [[MicroController]]



Contains:
+ transistors
+ resistors
+ capacitors
+ connections between them
The different components are fabricated onto a "chip" of semiconductor material, typically silicon

Used heavily in computer, smartphones, TV's, and many other electronics.

Classified as:
+ analog
+ digital
+ mixed signal(both analog & digital)




MicroController:

A microcontroller unit(MCU) is a small computer on a single chip.

It is also called a [[Integrated Circuit]](IC)

The following are key components of a microcontroller:
- Central processing unit (CPU): Colloquially referred to as the “brain” of the computer, the [CPU](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/central-processing-unit) serves as the core component responsible for executing instructions and controlling operations.
- Memory: Microcontrollers contain both volatile memory (RAM)—which, unlike program memory, stores temporary data that may be lost if the system loses power—and non-volatile flash memory for storing the microcontroller’s programming instruction set (firmware).  
- Peripherals: Depending on the intended application, a microcontroller might contain various auxiliary components, such as input/output (I/O) interfaces—including timers, counters, analog-to-digital (ADC) and digital-to-analog (DAC) signal converters (ADCs)—and communication protocols (UART, SPI, I2C). Auxiliaries might also include components like LCD screens, ethernet connectivity ports or interfaces for such types of modules.
Microcontrollers integrate processing, memory, IO peripherals(timers, counters, analog-to-digital converters) into one unit.

suited for applications requiring real time signal processing, like controlling motors and interfacing with sensors.

can be configured within an integrated IDE using many different languages.

Types of microcontrollers:

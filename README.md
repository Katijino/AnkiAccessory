RCOS Anki Accessory - Stuart Powers - September 16, 2025
Overview
Anki is a web and phone app most used for learning and memorizing information, especially in the language learning and medical fields. When using Anki, you progress through flashcards, and determine how easily you were able to recall the term, if at all. You do this by physically pressing a button on your phone or laptop, which can get tedious as reviews pile up. Personally, I like doing my reviews when I wake up in the morning, and get annoyed at having to reach my hand up to move my cursor and click in bed. My accessory is a remote that you can use to execute different commands for Anki, allowing you to do reviews while laying in bed, sitting on your couch, or lying back in your chair. The goal is for it to be usable to connect to IOS and PC to start.
Semester Goals
The overall goal of this semester is to design, develop, and test a functional prototype of the Anki Accessory Remote that enables convenient and seamless interaction with Anki on both iOS and PC. By the end of the semester, the accessory should be able to reliably connect to devices, transmit commands, and improve the user’s review experience. Over the course of the semester, I aim to research and identify the necessary hardware and software requirements, implement the initial integration of the remote with Anki, and refine the prototype to ensure consistent functionality. The project will emphasize both usability and reliability, with a focus on creating a polished model by December while leaving room for future enhancements such as customizable inputs or voice control.
Milestones
October – Research & Planning
Determine physical hardware components (microcontroller, connection method, buttons, casing).
Create GitHub repository for version control and documentation.
Decide on development language and environment.
Complete research on how to connect hardware to Anki on both iOS and PC.
November – Hardware & Software Integration
Establish a basic connection between hardware and software.
Implement initial button-mapping for Anki commands (e.g., "Again," "Good," "Easy").
Begin constructing the physical model of the remote.
December – Compatibility & Functionality
Finalize hardware model and ensure software connection is stable.
Test and confirm compatibility with both iOS and PC versions of Anki.
Debug and polish the prototype for consistent functionality.
End of Semester – Polish & Future Extensions
Refine hardware and software for comfort, usability, and reliability.
Document the process and results clearly in the GitHub repo.
Identify potential future features, such as vocal cues or customizable button mappings.
